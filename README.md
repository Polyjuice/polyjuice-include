Launcher's &lt;starcounter-include&gt;
==============

This is Launcher's version of [`<starcounter-include>`](https://github.com/Starcounter/starcounter-include).
Launcher overwrites it with is a custom element that not only let's you load HTML partials into your Starcounter page with full control over loaded `<script>`s and `<link rel="import">`s, but also allows you to gently manage output from many apps mixed by Starcounter mappings.

## Install

[Launcher](https://github.com/StarcounterSamples/Launcher) has it already pre-installed, under `/sys/starcounter-include/starcounter-include.html` (overwrites Starcounter's one), but if you want to use it separately as well.

Install the component using [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
$ bower install StarcounterSamples/launcher-include --save
```

Or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/StarcounterSamples/launcher-include/archive/master.zip).

## Usage

    ```

2. Import Custom Element:

    ```html
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/starcounter-include/starcounter-include.html">
    ```

3. Start using it!
