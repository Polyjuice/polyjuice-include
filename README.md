&lt;polyjuice-include&gt;
==============

`<polyjuice-include>` is a custom element that let's you load HTML partials into your Polyjuice page, it uses [`<imported-template>`](https://github.com/Juicy/imported-template), so, you can take full control over loaded `<script>`s and `<link rel="import">`s. Thanks to HTML Imports - caching, script execution, etc. is completely native.

In fact it's just `<template is="imported-template">` wrapped into meaningful container with some sugar attributes.

### Small sample

If you have **/app/sub/page/path.html**:
```html
<template>
	<h1>Hello {{username}}</h1>
</template>
```
and JSON view-model
```javascript
SubPageViewModel = {
  username: "World"
  html: "/app/sub/page/path.html"
}
```
You can put it on screen with
```html
<polyjuice-include partial="{{ SubPageViewModel }}"></polyjuice-include>
```
To produce
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Demo/Examples

[Example in Starcounter Fiddle!]()

### [`<imported-template>` Demo/Example](https://github.com/Juicy/imported-template#demoexamples)


## Features

 - Applies two-way databinding, even for nested asynchronously loaded `<polymer-element>`s,
 - Multiple (concatenated) templates per partial, 
 - Polymer's `<template>` features (binding, repeat, if, etc.),
 - HTML Imports features: 
  - Sends request for template only once (HTML Import's caching),
  - Supports `<script>, <link>, <style>` tags to be executed once,
  - Supports `<script>, <style>` tags per template instance.

### HTML Partial limitations

 - It should be W3C compliant Document body,
 - It should contain at least one `<template>` tag in root node.

### Partial conventions

 - View-model contains `Html` property with path to file (:construction:, or just inline markup).

## Install

Polyjuice has it already pre-installed, under `/sys/polyjuice-include/polyjuice-include.html`, but if you want to use it separately as well.

Install the component using [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
$ bower install Polyjuice/polyjuice-include --save
```

Or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/Polyjuice/polyjuice-include/archive/gh-pages.zip).

## Usage

1. Import Web Components' polyfill (if needed):

    ```html
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js">
    ```

2. Import Custom Element:

    ```html
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/polyjuice-include/polyjuice-include.html">
    ```

3. Start using it!

    ```html
    <polyjuice-include partial="{{ViewModel}}"></polyjuice-include>
    ```
    or without mustache-style data-binding:
    ```js
    document.querySelector("polyjuice-include").partial = ViewModel;
    ```
